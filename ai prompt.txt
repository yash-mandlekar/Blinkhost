Recreate this screenshot as an exact, pixel-perfect UI using Tailwind CSS. Maintain the same layout, spacing, typography, colors, and component styles exactly as shown in the screenshot. Do not introduce any additional styling, spacing, or elements beyond what is visible. The final code should be clean, responsive, and structured only with Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring it looks identical to the screenshot.
